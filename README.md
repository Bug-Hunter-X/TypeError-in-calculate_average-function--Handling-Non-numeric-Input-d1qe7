This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: a `TypeError` that arises when a function expects numeric input but receives a list containing non-numeric elements. The `calculate_average` function is designed to compute the average of a list of numbers. However, if the list contains strings or other non-numeric data, the `sum()` function will raise a `TypeError`. The solution provided shows how to handle this error gracefully by either filtering out non-numeric elements or using exception handling.
